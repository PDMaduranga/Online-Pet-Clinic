I developed a web application with two types of users: pet owners and pet clinics. Users can register and log in to the platform. Pet owners can submit queries to specific pet clinics, and the clinics can respond directly to those queries, enabling efficient communication and better pet care.
To run backend - npm run dev
To run frontend - npm start

I have host on render - https://online-pet-clinic-frontend.onrender.com
